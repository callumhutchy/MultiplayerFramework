# MultiplayerFramework

The server and client were first created using a tutorial from 
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16935/A-Chat-Application-Using-Asynchronous-UDP-sockets

The tutorial gave me a greater undertstanding of using UDP sockets in C#, I have greatly expanded the features of this tutorial
converting it from a messaging application to a game wide scope game server.

I aim to split this up into multiple server and client connections, currently the application functions as a game logic server and a chat server.
In the future these features should be seperated and turned into their own servers, this allows the ability to create a remote chat application much like the World of Warcraft Mobile Guild Chat.
